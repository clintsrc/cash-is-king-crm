# Executes for any PR the main branch, especially for 'Merge pull request'
# 'Merge pull request' is a push action, and in that case this script will execute a
# use a hook on the Render hosting service. Render will respond by pulling the source,
# running the production build and hosting the deployment.
#
# Note that changes to any PR targeting main will execute this script, but in that
# particular case, the script doesn't currently do anything. The reason is that it
# remains extensible for adding final pre-release actions such as a subset of sanity
# tests.

# The script can be monitored on a pull request's Checks tab
