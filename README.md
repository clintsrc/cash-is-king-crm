## Description
Cash is King is an interactive MERN Stack CRM web application utilizing React for the front end, GraphQL with a Node.js and Express.JS server, MongoDB and Mongoose ODM database, with JWT authentication integration. The combination of these technologies yields a user friendly atm service request for the business "Cash is King". Customers can submit requests but are restricted to accessing the full site functionality. Through user authentication, full site functionality is reserved strictly for admins to process requests and update services as progress is made.
